Welcome to Whisker Welfare Pro, the personal portfolio website for Ellyse Thomas - Advocate of the 3Rs in Animal Care.

## About Ellyse Thomas

![Ellyse Thomas Headshot](assets/Ellyse.jpg)

I am Ellyse Thomas, a passionate advocate for the 3Rs principles in animal care. The 3Rs, which stand for Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement, were introduced by Drs. William Russell and Rex Burch in 1959 in their book, "The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique."

### The 3Rs in Animal Care

#### Replacement

- **Full/Absolute Replacement:** Utilizing technologies that completely avoid the use of animals, such as training manikins, human tissues and cells, computer models, and microphysiological systems.

- **Partial/Relative Replacement:** In cases where animal use is still required, ensuring that animals do not experience pain or distress during the study. Examples include animal-derived tissue/organs for in vitro studies, zebrafish embryos, and transcutaneous electrical resistance tests.

#### Reduction

- Employing methods that enable comparable levels of information to be obtained from the use of fewer animals. This involves appropriate experimental design, correct statistical evaluation, and resource/animal sharing.

#### Refinement

- Making modifications to husbandry or experimental procedures to minimize or eliminate animals' pain and distress, thus improving their welfare. Examples include the use of anesthetics and analgesics, humane animal handling, environmental enrichments, and humane endpoints.

## My Advocacy

As an advocate of the 3Rs, I am committed to promoting ethical and humane approaches in animal care. Through my work and dedication, I strive to contribute to the betterment of animal welfare while maintaining scientific integrity.
